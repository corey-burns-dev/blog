## Back at it

I am getting back into coding with a clear goal: build every day, even if progress is small.

For a while, I was out of rhythm. Now I am returning to development with more focus, better habits, and a mindset of consistency over perfection.

## What this blog will track

- What I am learning as I re-enter day-to-day dev work.
- Small projects and experiments I ship along the way.
- Notes on tools, workflows, and lessons that actually help.

## Why now

I miss making things, solving problems, and watching ideas turn into working software. This is my reset point.

If you are also getting back into dev, you are not alone. Let us keep building.
