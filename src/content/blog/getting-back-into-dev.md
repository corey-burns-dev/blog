If you have a relatively modern PC (made in the last 10 years), you are better off running Arch Linux. Most people think Arch is some impenetrable fortress of complexity meant only for those who want to suffer through manual installations and broken dependencies. In reality, on modern hardware, it’s one of the most stable and performant experiences you can get.

## The "Complexity" is Gone

Remember the days of manually partitioning disks and editing fstab via the command line? While you still can (and it’s a great way to learn), tools like **archinstall** have turned the installation process into a simple series of about 6-7 menu selections. From choosing your desktop environment to setting up your disk encryption, it’s now a streamlined process that takes minutes, not hours.

## Bleeding Edge = Better Stability

It sounds counterintuitive, but for modern desktop usage, bleeding-edge packages are often more stable than "stable" LTS distros like Ubuntu. In the desktop world, "stable" usually just means "frozen in time." This leads to outdated packages that aren't fixed on a daily basis, forcing you to deal with bugs that were patched months ago on Arch.

There’s a reason Valve chose Arch as the base for the **Steam Deck**. When you're running the latest hardware, you need the latest kernel and drivers to actually make things work correctly without hair-pulling workarounds.

## CachyOS: Arch on Easy Mode

If you want to get even easier, **CachyOS** is currently one of the most popular Arch-based distros for a reason. It gives you a full desktop GUI installer with amazing defaults out of the box.

But it’s not just about ease of use; it’s about raw power. Benchmarks show significant performance boosts on CachyOS, especially if you're running an all-AMD system. On my own rig, I see much higher 4k minimum FPS compared to other distros, and honestly, it feels faster than Windows for my daily workflows.

Stop spending your time fighting outdated packages on "stable" distros. Switch to Arch (or CachyOS) and let your hardware actually breathe.
