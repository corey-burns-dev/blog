## Quiet structure, bold results

Math isn’t just numbers. It’s balance, proportion, and predictability. The best interfaces borrow that calm.

### Where it shows up

- Grid systems that scale without breaking.
- Consistent type ratios for readable hierarchy.
- Spacing rhythms that make layouts feel effortless.

### The takeaway

If the system is right, the visuals feel inevitable. That’s the kind of elegance I want every page to carry.
