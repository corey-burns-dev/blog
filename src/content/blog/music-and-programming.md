## Rhythm in the build

Great code has tempo: a predictable cadence, a clean progression, and just enough tension to keep you engaged.

### Patterns that repeat well

- Clear naming that feels like a steady beat.
- Reusable components that carry the melody.
- Consistent spacing that keeps the mix clean.

### The outcome

The result is software that feels composed—not chaotic. The UI becomes a track you want to replay.

That’s the vibe I chase in every build.
