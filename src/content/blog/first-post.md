## Welcome to the studio

This is the start of a new journal—focused on shipping beautiful, high-performance web experiences. I’ll share quick notes, small experiments, and what I learn along the way.

### What I’m building right now

- A modular design system for fast-moving product teams.
- A streamlined content workflow for ship-ready launches.
- A tighter feedback loop between design and code.

If you want to collaborate, reach out anytime. Let’s build something sleek.
