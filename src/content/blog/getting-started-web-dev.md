## The modern stack, simplified

If you’re starting today, focus on a stack that is fast to ship and easy to maintain. The point is momentum, not complexity.

### A clean baseline

- Component-driven UI with strong conventions.
- Design tokens to keep visuals consistent.
- Performance first: image sizing, lazy loading, minimal scripts.

### The workflow

Design with intent, then implement in small, reviewable slices. Every iteration should make the product feel calmer and more deliberate.

Ship fast, polish later, and keep your system tight.
